Created by: Peyton Waterman

This project reads in html tags and can display certain informmation about songs in regard to authors, songs, and albums.

A variety of information is given about about these topics such as genre of music year of release and a biography of the 
 artists.

Input for this programs requires JSON files of the different artists, tracklists, list of albums, and images of artists and 
 albums (see InputFiles folder for reference)


Bugs: Minor formatting issues as you get further down the output in webbrowser and images may not load due to
		possibility of source of pictures changing and being unavailable.
